# Hotel_analysis_project

1. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a restaurant dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover insights related to cuisine types, city-wise distribution, and pricing.

2. Identified top 3 most common cuisines served and calculated their distribution percentages to understand customer preferences.

3. Analyzed city-wise restaurant availability and ratings, including finding the city with the highest number of restaurants and the one with the best average ratings.

4. Visualized price range distribution using bar charts and calculated the percentage of restaurants falling into different pricing categories.

5. Evaluated the impact of online delivery by comparing average customer ratings between restaurants with and without online delivery services.

6. Ensured data cleanliness by checking for duplicates and missing values, contributing to more accurate insights and visualizations.
